strnum.sh
	This file contains my updated version of bash functions that do decimal arithmetic, grab numbers from files, treats them as arrays, etc...
	I'll copy/paste these functions into other bash scripts that need them for whatever.
	It's not noted out terribly well, but hopefully it makes sense - at least Jason has found it useful in the past.

test.txt
	This is just a test file to make sure that the functions in ./strnum.sh are working properly.
